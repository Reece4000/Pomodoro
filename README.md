25 minute timer for work, followed by a 5 minute rest, then repeat. 

A jingle plays at the start and end of each work stint. This can be muted by pressing the icon at the top left of the interface.

After each stint a pomodoro is earned, and appears on the right side of the UI. After 8 Pomodoros are earned, the user is rewarded with the Golden Pom. 

During each work stint, a random inspirational quote about hard work is displayed to the user.

The timer can be paused or reset at any time.
